# Welcome to this homework for BED-2056
 
This is a mandatory homework assignment which will give you an introduction to git, RMarkdown, and projects in R.

The assignment must be done in two steps:

## Step 1

Create a [github account (www.github.com)](https://www.github.com) and send your account details to marius.runningen.larsson@nmbu.no. It must include

```
name: your name
username: your username
email: your email
```

Do this as soon as possible. I have to grant you write permission to this repository.

## Step 2
 
After you've been invited to modify this repository, clone it as we did in class (or see lecture notes). You will then create a **new** Rmarkdown document (.Rmd) which you will place in the **submissions** folder. The name of the .Rmd document should be `git_submission_your_name.Rmd`. The .Rmd document should contain the following:

```
- Create a plot of something interesting or something random. It doesn't really matter as long as you create a plot of some data. You can modify and style it as much or as little as you like.
- In 1-2 sentences either above or bellow the plot, explain what the plot shows.
- The document must be knitable!
```

When you're done with the .Rmd document, you will commit and push it to the repository. 

Remember: your submission will be open for everyone to see.
